# The Good Research Code Handbook source

This is the source for the Good Research Code Handbook, by Patrick Mineault. The website lives at [goodresearch.dev](https://goodresearch.dev). This book uses jupyterbook to build, with a highly customized theme based off of `tufte.css`.

## Reporting issues with the website

Please report any issues via the Issues tab.

## Building the book

Recreate the conda environment with:

`conda env create -n cb --file environment.yml`

Then `conda activate cb`.

Run `jupyter-book build .` to build.

Use Run `jupyter-book build . --all` to force a full rebuild.

The book can be visualized locally using a development server. Typically, I use `netlify dev` for this purpose.

To remove `thebe.js` includes (which causes a 500KB javascript file to be loaded), run `python strip_js.py` (a hack).

Use `netlify deploy -d _build/html --prod` to deploy.

_Note_: when you push a PR through Github, it will build a preview of your work through Netlify automatically. When I merge the PR, it will automatically deploy the built website to [goodresearch.dev](https://goodresearch.dev).

## Building the book to PDF

Manually change `_config.yml` so the author name appears correctly:

`author: "Patrick Mineault"`

Use `jupyter-book build . --builder pdflatex` to build to PDF. [See here for the required environment](https://jupyterbook.org/advanced/pdf.html).
