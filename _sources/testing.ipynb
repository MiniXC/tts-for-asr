    "Most scientists who write software constantly test their code. That is, if you are a scientist writing software, I am sure that you have tried to see how well your code works by running every new function you write, examining the inputs and the outputs of the function, to see if the code runs properly (without error), and to see whether the results make sense. Automated code testing takes this informal practice, makes it formal, and automates it, so that you can make sure that your code does what it is supposed to do, even as you go about making changes around it.\n",

Imagine that you had an experimental setup that alerted you when you had a ground loop, or that would sound off when you use the wrong reagent, or that would text you when it's about to overheat - how many hours or days would you save?\n",

    "There's no ideal number per say, but 1:1 to 3:1 is a commonly quoted range for library code. For one-off code, you can usually get away with less test coverage. For more down-to-earth applications, 80% test coverage is a common target. [You can use the `Coverage.py` package to figure out your test coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.3.1/).\n",

    "Testing allows you to decrease the uncertainty surface of your code. With the right tests, you can convince yourself that parts of your code are _correct_, and that allows you to concentrate your debugging efforts. Keeping that uncertainty out of your head saves your working memory, and debugging will be faster and more efficient. At the same time, code with tests is less stressful to refactor, so you will be able to continuously improve your code so that it doesn't slide towards an unmanageable mess of spaghetti.\n",
