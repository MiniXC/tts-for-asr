    "Some common issues are caused by using an idiom from another programming language in Python, where it doesn't translate. Many people using the Python data science ecosystem either come from a Matlab background, or were trained by someone who came from a Matlab background. As a consequence, they'll tend to write Matlab-like code, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Using magic columns numbers to index into a numpy array_. Matlab has a matrix type that it uses for many things. You might use the tenth column of a matrix to store a timestamp, which creates hard-to-read code. Dataframes are more appropriate to store parallel data. In 3 months from now, `A.timestamp` will be far clearer than `A[:, 10]`. [You can learn the basics of `pandas` in a weekend](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook), and it's a great time investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Using unnamed dimensions in numpy_. Similarly, tensors with multiple dimensions can pose problems. If you have a mini-batch of images you're preparing for a deep learning pipeline, did the dimensions go `batch_size x channels x height x width`, or `batch_size x width x height x channels`? [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) and [named tensors in pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/named_tensor.html) give you named dimensions, which will reduce your confusion down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Using bespoke casting for string formatting_. Python has a great string formatting method since version 3.6: [the f-string](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/). Generating a file name for a checkpoint with `f\"{model_name}_{iteration}.pkl\"` is more intuitive and readable than `model_name + '_' + str(iteration) + '.pkl'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Avoiding for loops_. You may have been taught to avoid for loops as much as possible in Matlab by vectorizing everything. However, this often sacrifices readability. Tricky indexing may look clever, but can be next to impossible to debug. Because Python has a different performance profile than Matlab, some Matlab-specific optimizations won't make your code faster. For instance, unlike Matlab vectors, Python lists are very cheap to grow. Appending to a list in a for loop and then turning that list into a numpy array in a single call has little performance overhead compared to preallocating.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, modern Matlab doesn't have to be written this way: for instance, Matlab has a capable dataframe class. But a lot of people that come from Matlab still use old Matlab idioms.

    "\n",
    "Decoupled code is something we all strive towards. Yet, code often has a natural tendency to become more and more tightly wound over time until it becomes an unmanageable mess. The strategies in this chapter will help you to identify code smells and correct them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure functions are easier to reason about, because they're stateless - that saves your working memory when you're reading code. Code that follows Python's idioms is also easier on your working memory: when you see a line of code that is a familiar pattern, you can see the entire line as one chunk rather than multiple disparate bits. That takes one working memory slot rather than several.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing existing code is not without its dangers, however. Perhaps we will make a mistake and introduce a bug in our code! How can we check that our improved code still does the correct thing? We'll cover this in the next chapter on testing.\n",
