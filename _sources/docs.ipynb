    "Good documentation helps maintain the long-term memory of a project. Very tricky code must be documented with care so that the memory of its intent and implementation is preserved. However, if you have a choice between documenting tricky code and refactoring the code so that it's less tricky, you'll often find that refactoring code pays off over the long term. Similarly, it's often more productive to write unit tests that lock in how the code works than to explain how the code _should_ work in words. Document code that needs to be documented, improve the code that can be improved, and develop the wisdom to tell them apart.\n",
